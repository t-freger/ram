# Support The Project

## Contributing

1. Testing - Using ram and reporting bugs is a great way to help support the project. Found a bug? [Open an issue on GitHub][github-issue].
1. Translations - The ram mobile app has been translated into [17 languages][github-langs] so far! To contribute with translations, email me at alex.tran1502@gmail.com or send me a message on discord.
1. Development - If you are a programmer or developer, take a look at ram's [technology stack](/docs/developer/architecture.mdx) and consider fixing bugs or building new features. The team and I are always looking for new contributors. For information about how to contribute as a developer, see the [Developer](/docs/developer/architecture.mdx) section.
