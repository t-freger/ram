# Partner Sharing

:::tip Sharing specific assets
For sharing a specific set of assets, you can use the shared album feature of ram.
:::

ram allows you to share your library with other users. They can then view your library and download the assets. You can manage Partner Sharing from the [User Settings](docs/features/user-settings.md) page on the web.

Partner Sharing includes:

- Access to all non-archived and trashed photos and videos.
- Access to all metadata, including GPS information.
- Access to share assets via shared links, albums, etc.

:::info
Partner sharing is one-way. To view your partner's assets, they must also share them with you.
